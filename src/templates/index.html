  <h1>Fix your Goodbudget .csv files</h1>
  <p><small>The .csv exports generated by Goodbudget have <a href=https://getsatisfaction.com/goodbudget/topics/optionally_export_multiple_rows_for_split_transactions">missing lines for <br />
  split transactions</a>. This small tool splits every row with such a transaction <br />
  into several rows, one for each envelope. The original row is removed.</small></p>
  <p><small>Select a CSV file to convert and press "Convert!"</small></p>
  {% if messages %}<ul class=flashes>
    {% for message in messages %}
      <li>{{ message }}</li>{% endfor %}
    </ul>{% endif %}
  <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input name="file" type="file" accept="text/*"> 
    <input type=submit value="Convert!">
</form>
<p><small>The file you upload will not be stored. <br />
Only files with the ending .csv/.txt and a size of less than 4MB are supported.<br />
There are no guarantees for the correctness of the results, use this tool at <br />
your own risk! However, should you find any errors, send me a an email and if <br />
possible include a redacted version of your file so I can take a look. Remove <br />
any sensitive information such as account numbers, names, or passwords.<br />
This tool will be discontinued as soon as the Goodbudget CSV export is <a href=https://getsatisfaction.com/goodbudget/topics/optionally_export_multiple_rows_for_split_transactions">fixed</a>.</small></p>
